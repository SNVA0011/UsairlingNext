                    <p>If wonder of the worlds excites you, if your interest lies in the unfathomable, if you wish to explore the most magical, mystical, and inconceivable, you have to explore the Bolivian lands. From the depths of water to the heights of mountains, find it all on a single landmass. </p>


                    <p className='font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-0'>Lake Titicaca (Cradle of the World)</p>
                    <p>Land to the floating islands, Yes, floating! This landmass also holds the title of the highest lake globally, at the height of 12,500 feet above sea level, and the largest lake in South America. If this is not enough to urge you to look for <strong>Lake Titicaca flights</strong>, then perhaps the fact that Isla del Sol, the largest island on Bolivian land, houses roughly 180 Inca ruins can motivate you. This land that started with an earthquake 60 million years ago will sweep you off your feet. </p>


                    <p className='font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-0'>Reaching the Lake</p>
                    <p>Since both Bolivia and Peru share this lake, you can pick where you want to start this journey, although 3,690 km square of the lake's surface area is on the Bolivian territory, out of 8,400 km square, leaving 4710 Km square to Peru. You can choose to travel from the town of Puno in Peru or Copacabana to Bolivian lands. The option to select the <strong>best Lake Titicaca flights</strong> is yours.</p>


                    <p className='font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-0'>Flights to Lake Titicaca</p>
                    <p>The closest airport to Lake Titicaca is the Inca Manco Cápac International Airport. This airport is located in Juliaca(Peru), 44Km away from the lake. Since Peru shares most of the lake's surface area and is closest to Lake Titicaca, you should consider flying to Peru first. You can take a local bus ($5 per person) or a cab($20-$25 per trip) to the lake from the airport. So if you are traveling alone, a local bus is the best option, but if you are in a group, getting a cab will prove cheaper.</p>


                    <p>Now comes the question, which flights fly to Inca Manco Cápac International Airport?</p>

                    </ul>
